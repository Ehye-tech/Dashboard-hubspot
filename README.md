I'd be glad to create the installation instructions for your README.md file, incorporating the best aspects of the provided responses and addressing any potential shortcomings:

**Installation Instructions**

**Prerequisites**

- **Node.js and npm :** These are essential for running the project and managing dependencies. 

**Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dashboard-hubspot.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd dashboard-hubspot
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Run one of the following commands in your terminal to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install  # Using npm
   ```

   This will download and install all the necessary libraries and packages that your project relies on.

**Running the Project**

**1. Environment Variables:**

   Before starting the project, you'll need to configure your HubSpot API credentials. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory (**not** included in version control) and set the following environment variables:

   ```
   HUBSPOT_API_KEY=your_hubspot_api_key
   ```

   Replace `your_hubspot_api_key` with your actual HubSpot API key, which you can obtain from your HubSpot developer account.

**2. Start the Server:**

   ```bash
   node index.js  
   ```

   This will start the Node.js server and make the dashboard application accessible. The exact location of the dashboard might vary depending on your server setup. Consult your server documentation for details on accessing applications.
